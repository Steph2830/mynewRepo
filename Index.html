<h2 class="center">Fallout 4:</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-4-quotes-stick-forever/">
<p id="para3">  Fallout 4 is among the strongest games in the entire franchise, and for a good reason. The world is massive and immersive,
  the characters feel real and interesting, and your choices have lasting effects on the landscape of the Commonwealth. 
  It also has one of the most compelling main storylines that sends us on a hot pursuit after our baby son Shaun.
